However, the minimax algorithm allows us to make one specific, informed move, giving us a better move than random chance.

    "With ten plies, It takes about 0.4 seconds for a game to run to completion, and AI wins around 99% of the time, with about 13 moves. With only about 0.05 more seconds per game, the AI wins almost 100% of the time in around 2 less moves than the minimax and alpha-beta AI player. Increasing the number of plies increases the success rate of the AI player because it means that the alpha-beta algorithm is going through multiple rounds of the game to see which current action will be most favorable in the long run.\n",

    "The utility function is better than the one given to us, since we are considering what moves can be made by each player, and not just who has the most amount of marbles in their mancala at any given point in time. Most importantly, it was missing the importance of captures. Even if a player has the most marbles in their mancala with a move, they could be leaving their board open to more captures in following moves by the opponent, leading to the AI making a \"bad\" move. We improved our utility function by accounting for how many marbles were in each player's mancala, how many marbles were on each player's side of the board, and how many pits were available to take from for any given player. We set different weights for each of these, including a negative weight for the opponent since we don't want to make a move that would benefit the opponent. Our utility function places more value on having more marbles in the pits and more spaces to move from, since this gives us more moves to take but also could allow us to put more marbles in our mancala. We also considered stones already in our mancala, but gave it a lesser weight since this is not what we want to prioritize in our utility function. By using the average of stones per non-empty pit, we can determine a numeric value for how \"actionable\" we are, giving us more moves to make, and potentially better moves to make. This utility function is a better way to evaluate the strength of a match because it is considering long term scores and actions, rather than immediate success. This is better because it considers the potential a player has to win, and thinks in the long run for moves to make that would produce a win. "
